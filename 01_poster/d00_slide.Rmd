<!-- "Now, let's break down the components of a poster.

First, the title should be clear and concise, capturing the essence of your research.

Next, you should list the authors and their affiliations, so viewers know who conducted the research and where it was done.

The abstract is a brief summary of your research, including the key objectives, methods, results, and conclusions.

The introduction or background section provides the context and significance of your research."
