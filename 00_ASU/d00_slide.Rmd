<!-- In my upcoming talk, 'GitHub (and Data Science Tools) for Psychologists,'  I will showcase the expansive capabilities of GitHub. Initially conceived for software developers, this version control platform holds untapped potential for the psychology community. We’ll start by showcasing applications of GitHub, from managing research labs and teaching courses to publishing academic papers. Following this, I will provide an overview of the platform, shedding light on how it facilitates project management, code sharing, and tool development through its tracking and collaboration features. Tailored specifically for psychologists, this session will demonstrate practical ways in which GitHub can enhance research productivity and collaboration. Join us to explore how GitHub transcends its software development origins to become an indispensable tool in the field of psychology. -->

## Terminology Cheat Sheet

- **Repositories (Repo)**: Store your projects in repositories, including all files, revisions, and documentation.
- **Commits**: Save changes to your project, creating a transparent history of your work and decisions.
- **Push**: Send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com.
- **Pull**: Fetch changes from a remote repository and merge them into your local repository.
--

- **Pull Requests**: Propose changes to a project and discuss those changes with project collaborators before merging them.
- **Branches**: Work on different versions of a repository at the same time, allowing for parallel development.
- **Issues**: Track ideas, enhancements, tasks, or bugs for your projects. Organize with labels, assignees, and milestones.

## Version control

- We introduced GitHub as a platform for collaboration
- But it's much more than that...
- It's actually designed for version control

---

## Versioning

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/lego-steps.png")
```

---

## Versioning (with human readable messages)

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/lego-steps-commit-messages.png")
```

---

## Why do we need version control?

# Git and GitHub tips

- Git is a version control system -- like “Track Changes” features from Microsoft Word on steroids. GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet -- like DropBox but much, much better).

--
- There are millions of git commands -- ok, that's an exaggeration, but there are a lot of them -- and very few people know them all. 99% of the time you will use git to add, commit, push, and pull.

--
- We will be doing Git things and interfacing with GitHub through RStudio/GitHub Desktop, but if you google for help you might come across methods for doing these things in the command line -- skip that and move on to the next resource unless you feel comfortable trying it out.

--
- There is a great resource for working with git and R: [happygitwithr.com](http://happygitwithr.com/). Some of the content in there is beyond the scope of this talk, but it's a good place to look for help.

## Let's take a tour - Git and GitHub

.center[
![](../img/demo.png)
]

- Connect an R project to Github repository
- Working with a local and remote repository
- Making a change locally, committing, and pushing
- Making a change on GitHub and pulling


---

## Create a GitHub account

.small[
.instructions[
Go to [github.com](https://github.com/), and create an account (unless you already have one)... This is going to be the first step of the activity, so you can get ahead and do it now.

Tips for selecting a username:<sup>✦</sup>

.small[
- Incorporate your actual name.
- Reuse username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack.
- Pick a username you'll be comfortable revealing to your future boss.
- Shorter is better than longer.
- Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible.
- Make it timeless. Don't highlight your current university, employer, etc.
- Avoid words laden with special meaning in programming, like `NA`.
