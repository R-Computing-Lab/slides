## My Work

<!-- rewrite -->

- My substantive work focuses on examining the relationships between socioeconomic status, individual differences, and health.
- I use genetically-informed designs to approach these questions, leveraging cousins, siblings, and other kin.
- I rely heavily on pre-existing data sets, working with tons data, quite literally in some cases.
- My current work is heavily centered around data modeling for all people of Utah and their ancestors. 
  - We've (Mike Hunter & Alex Burt) developed some novel pedigree models to comparing cousins up to the 11th degree. 
  - At the moment, we're looking at outcomes that the National Institute on Aging (NIA) is interested in....

## Why I'm Here Today

<!-- rewrite -->.large[
- I'm passionate about sharing my love for R and data science with others, especially those within the field of psychology.
- I believe that the tools and methodologies of data science can 
  - meaningfully enhance our ability to conduct efficient and impactful research in psychology
- I'm excited to be here and share this course with you!

Data science is an exciting discipline that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge. We're going to learn to do this in a `tidy` way -- more on that later!

# Reproducible data analysis

---

## Reproducibility checklist

.question[
What does it mean for a data analysis to be "reproducible"?
]

--

Near-term goals:

- Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
- Does the code actually do what you think it does?
- In addition to what was done, is it clear **why** it was done? 
(e.g., how were parameter settings chosen?)

--

Long-term goals:

- Can the code be used for other data?
- Can you extend the code to do other things?

---

## Toolkit

![toolkit](img/toolkit.png)

- Scriptability $\rightarrow$ R
- Literate programming (code, narrative, output in one place) $\rightarrow$ R Markdown
- Version control $\rightarrow$ Git / GitHub

# R and RStudio

---

## What is R/RStudio?

- R is a statistical programming language
- RStudio is a convenient interface for R (an integrated development environment, IDE)
- At its simplest:
    - R is like a car's engine
    - RStudio is like a carâ€™s dashboard

```{r fig.align="center", echo=FALSE, out.width="66%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/engine-dashboard.png")
```


---

## Let's take a tour - R / RStudio

.center[
![](img/demo.png)
]

- Console
- Using R as a calculator
- Environment
- Loading and viewing a data frame
- Accessing a variable in a data frame
- R functions


---

## Tour: Working with R at the command line 

- Launch RStudio/R.
- Notice the default panes:
    - Console (entire left)
    - Environment/History (tabbed in upper right)
    - Files/Plots/Packages/Help (tabbed in lower right)


--

- FYI: You can change the default location of the panes, among many other things
  - [Customizing RStudio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200549016-Customizing-RStudio)

---

## Tour: Working with R at the command line (pt 2)

- Go into the Console, where we interact with the live R process.
- Make an assignment and then inspect the object you just created:

```{r start_rbasics}
x <- 3 * 4
x
```

- All R statements where you create objects -- "assignments" -- have this form:

```{r eval = FALSE}
objectName <- value
```

- Read this as 'x gets 12'


.footnote[and in my head I hear, e.g., "x gets 12".

You will make lots of assignments and the operator `<-` is a pain to type. Don't be lazy and use `=`, although it would work, because it will just sow confusion later. Instead, utilize RStudio's keyboard shortcut: Alt + - (the minus sign).]


---

## R essentials

A short list (for now):

- Functions are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses:

```{r eval=FALSE}
do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```

--

- Columns (variables) in data frames are accessed with `$`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
dataframe$var_name
```

--

- Packages are installed with the `install.packages` function and loaded with the `library` function, once per session:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("package_name")
library(package_name)
```

## tidyverse

.pull-left[

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/hexs.png")
```
]
]
.pull-right[
.center[
[tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org/)]
- The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science.
- All packages share an underlying philosophy and common grammar: the "tidy data" principles.
- "Tidy data" has a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table.

- Key packages include: 
  - **ggplot2** for data visualization.
  - **dplyr** for data manipulation.
  - **tidyr** for data tidying.
  - **readr** for data import.
  - **purrr** for functional programming.
  - **tibble** for tibble, a modern reimagining of data frames.
  - **stringr** for string manipulation.
  - **forcats** for handling categorical variables.
- These packages are designed to work together seamlessly.

# R Markdown

## R Markdown

- .large[Fully reproducible reports -- each time you knit the analysis is run from the beginning]
- .large[Simple markdown syntax for text]
- .large[Code goes in chunks, defined by three backticks, while narrative goes outside of chunks]
---

## Let's take a tour - R Markdown


.center[
![](img/demo.png)
]

Concepts introduced:

- Copying a project
- Knitting documents
- R Markdown and (some) R syntax

---

.your-turn[

- The Bechdel test asks whether a work of fiction features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man, and there must be two women named characters.
- Go to github page and download the assignment `Bechdel + R Markdown`. 
- Open and knit the R Markdown document `bechdel.Rmd` and follow along with the instructions.

## Workspaces

Remember this, and expect it to bite you a few times as you're learning to work with R Markdown: The workspace of your R Markdown document is separate from the Console!

- Run the following in the console
```{r eval = FALSE}
x <- 2
x * 3
```
.question[
All looks good, eh?
]

- Then, add the following chunk in your R Markdown document
```{r eval = FALSE}
x * 3
```
--
.question[
What happens? Why the error?
]

## Asking good questions

.pull-left[
- **Good:** Describe your intention and include your code and the error
- **Better:** Describe your intention and create a minimum working example
- **Best:** Write a **rep**roducible **ex**ample (reprex) -- we'll introduce this concept more formally and teach you the tools for it a little later in the semester

- Use code formatting
- For issues with R code: copy / paste your code and resulting error, don't use screenshots!
