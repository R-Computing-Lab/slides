**Characteristics of tidy data:**

- Each variable forms a column.
- Each observation forms a row.
- Each type of observational unit forms a table.

  group_by(gender) %>%

## Data structures in R
Three main ways to store data:

- Matrix: 
  - Requires all the elements to be of the same type (e.g. numeric or character)
- Data frame: 
  - Allows for mixed types of variables
- Tibble: 
  - Like a data frame, but works more consistently

---
## Tibbles

Tibbles are a better version of data frames.

- The [documentation](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) describes them as 

--
>"data.frames for the lazy and surly: 
>
>they do less 
>
>(i.e. they don’t change variable names or types,
>
>and don’t do partial matching)
>
>and complain more
>s
>(e.g. when a variable does not exist)."

---

## Two other advantages:

1. They subset more consistently: 
  - when you use square brackets to subset a tibble, 
      - you always get another tibble. 
  - With data frames, you sometimes get a vector and sometimes get a data frame.
2. They print more elegantly.

--

#### Compared to base R
+ Base R functions, (including those for data frames), 
  + try to guess what you want to do.
+ Sometimes, this "helpful" guessing  leads to unexpected outcomes, 
  + so tibbles have done away with most of that.

---

## Tibbles don't change names

. . .
.midi[
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
(df = data.frame("a" = 1:5, "b 2" = 5:1))
(ti = tibble("a" = 1:5, "b 2" = 5:1))
```
]
---

## Tibbles complain about bad column names

. . .

```{r}
df$c
ti$c
```

---

## Tibbles subset consistently

. . .

```{r}
df[,1]
ti[,1]
```

---

## Tibbles don't *do* partial matching

. . .

```{r}
df$b
ti$b
```
---

## Tibbles don't coerce strings to factors

Previously...
```{r}
df = data.frame(l1 = letters[1:5])
```
```{r,include=FALSE}
df = data.frame(l1 = letters[1:5],stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```
The most annoying thing about data frames:
```{r}
df$l2 = letters[1:5]
class(df$l1)
class(df$l2)
```

---

# Tibbles don't have this problem
```{r}
## but with tibbles it's all the same
ti = tibble(l1 = letters[1:5])
ti$l2 = letters[1:5]
class(ti$l1)
class(ti$l2)
```

## Ok...So... technically... 

Base R has fixed this issue...

```{r}
df = data.frame(l1 = letters[1:5])
df$l2 = letters[1:5]
class(df$l1)
class(df$l2)
```
