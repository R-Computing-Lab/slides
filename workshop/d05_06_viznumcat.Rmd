# Introduction to Visualizing Data

---

## Terminology and Overview

<br>

In this chunk, we will delve into the fascinating world of data visualization.

We'll cover:

- Univariate data analysis - distribution of single variable
- Bivariate data analysis - relationship between two variables
- Multivariate data analysis - relationship between many variables at once, usually focusing on the relationship between two while conditioning for others


- Variables can be **Numerical** (classified as **continuous** or **discrete**)¹ .footnote[¹based on whether or not the variable can take on an infinite number of values or only non-negative whole numbers, respectively.] or 
  - **Categorical** (determined as **ordinal** or not based on the natural ordering of levels).

# Data

## Data: Lending Club

.pull-left-wide[

- Thousands of loans made through the Lending Club,
  - a platform that allows individuals to lend to each other
- Not all loans are created equal 
  - ease of getting a loan depends on (apparent) ability to repay the loan
- Data includes loans *made*, rather than loan applications.
]
.pull-right-narrow[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/lending-club.png")
```
]

---

## A Glimpse at the Data

We'll start by getting a brief overview of our dataset. 
.medi[
```{r output.lines=15}
library(openintro)
glimpse(loans_full_schema)
```
]
---

## Selected variables

We then select a subset of variables that are particularly relevant for our exploration:

```{r}
loans <- loans_full_schema %>%
  select(loan_amount, interest_rate, term, grade, 
         state, annual_income, homeownership, debt_to_income)
glimpse(loans)
```

---

## Selected variables

Here's a brief description of these variables:

<br>

.midi[
variable        | description    | type
----------------|----------------|-------------
`loan_amount`   |	Amount of the loan received, in US dollars | numerical, continuous
`interest_rate` |	Interest rate on the loan, in an annual percentage | numerical, continuous
`term`	        | The length of the loan, which is always set as a whole number of months | numerical, discrete
`grade`	        | .midi[Loan grade, which takes a values A through G and represents the quality of the loan and its likelihood of being repaid ]| categorical, ordinal
`state`         |	US state where the borrower resides | categorical, not ordinal
`annual_income` |	Borrower's annual income, including any second income, in US dollars | numerical, continuous
`homeownership`	| Indicates whether the person owns, owns but has a mortgage, or rents | categorical, .medi[not ordinal]
`debt_to_income` | Debt-to-income ratio | numerical, continuous

# Visualizing Numerical Data

```{r, eval=FALSE,include=FALSE}
<!--
- Before we jump into visualizing numerical data, let's take a moment to discuss why it's important. 
- Numerical data visualization allows us to see patterns, trends, and distributions in data. 
- They provide a graphical representation of data which helps in understanding complex data easily. Let's start with Histograms.
-->
```

```{r, eval=FALSE,include=FALSE}
<!--
---

## Describing shapes of numerical distributions

- shape:
    - skewness: right-skewed, left-skewed, symmetric (skew is to the side of the longer tail)
    - modality: unimodal, bimodal, multimodal, uniform
- center: mean (`mean`), median (`median`), mode (not always useful)
- spread: range (`range`), standard deviation (`sd`), inter-quartile range (`IQR`)
- unusual observations

## Histograms

---

## Histogram: `loan_amount`

```{r message = TRUE, out.width = "30%"}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = loan_amount)) +
  geom_histogram()
```


---

## Histograms and Binwidth

Let's explore the `loan_amount` variable with different binwidths.

.pull-left[
```{r out.width = "80%"}
ggplot(loans, 
       aes(x = loan_amount)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000)
```
]
--
.pull-right[
```{r out.width = "80%"}
ggplot(loans, 
       aes(x = loan_amount)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5000)
```
]
---

```{r out.width = "50%"}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = loan_amount)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 20000)
```

---


## Customizing histograms

We can further customize the histograms by adjusting labels, colors, and other properties.

.pull-left[

```{r ref.label = "hist-custom",out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
```

]
.pull-right[.small[
```{r hist-custom, fig.show = "hide", warning = FALSE}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = loan_amount)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5000) +
  labs( #<<
    x = "Loan amount ($)", #<<
    y = "Frequency", #<<
    title = "Amounts of Lending Club loans" #<<
  ) #<<
```
]
]


---

## Fill with a categorical variable

.pull-left[
```{r ref.label = "hist-fill",out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
```
]
.pull-right[.small[
```{r hist-fill, fig.show = "hide", warning = FALSE}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = loan_amount, 
                  fill = homeownership)) + #<<
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5000,
                 alpha = 0.5) + #<<
  labs(
    x = "Loan amount ($)",
    y = "Frequency",
    title = "Amounts of Lending Club loans"
  )
```
]
]

---

## Facet with a categorical variable

.pull-left[
```{r ref.label = "hist-facet", out.width = "100%",echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
```
]
.pull-right[.small[
```{r hist-facet, fig.show = "hide", warning = FALSE}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = loan_amount, fill = homeownership)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5000) +
  labs(
    x = "Loan amount ($)",
    y = "Frequency",
    title = "Amounts of Lending Club loans"
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~ homeownership, nrow = 3) #<<
```
]
]

## Density Plots

---

## Density Plot

```{r,out.width = "50%"}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = loan_amount)) +
  geom_density()
```

---

## Density plots and adjusting bandwidth

Density plots allow us to visualize the distribution of numerical data with varying bandwidths.

.pull-left[
+ adjust = 0.5
```{r out.width = "50%"}
ggplot(loans, 
       aes(x = loan_amount)) +
  geom_density(adjust = 0.5)
```
]
.pull-right[
+ adjust = 1
```{r out.width = "50%"}
ggplot(loans, 
       aes(x = loan_amount)) +
  geom_density(adjust = 1) # default bandwidth
```
]
---

# adjust = 2
```{r out.width = "50%"}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = loan_amount)) +
  geom_density(adjust = 2)
```

---

## Customizing Density Plots

We can customize density plots by adding labels, titles, and adjusting other visual properties.

.pull-left[
```{r ref.label = "density-custom", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE,out.width = "100%"}
```
]
.pull-right[.small[
```{r density-custom, fig.show = "hide", warning = FALSE}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = loan_amount)) +
  geom_density(adjust = 2) +
  labs( #<<
    x = "Loan amount ($)", #<<
    y = "Density", #<<
    title = "Amounts of Lending Club loans" #<<
  ) #<<
```
]
]





---

## Adding a categorical variable

.pull-left[
```{r ref.label = "density-cat", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE,out.width = "100%"}
```
]
.pull-right[.small[
```{r density-cat, fig.show = "hide", warning = FALSE}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = loan_amount, 
                  fill = homeownership)) + #<<
  geom_density(adjust = 2, 
               alpha = 0.5) + #<<
  labs(
    x = "Loan amount ($)",
    y = "Density",
    title = "Amounts of Lending Club loans", 
    fill = "Homeownership" #<<
  )
```
]
]

## Box plot

```{r}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = interest_rate)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

---

## Box plot and outliers

```{r}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = annual_income)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

---

## Customizing box plots

.pull-left[
```{r ref.label = "box-custom", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE,out.width = "100%"}
```
]
.pull-right[.small[
```{r box-custom, fig.show = "hide", warning = FALSE}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = interest_rate)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    x = "Interest rate (%)",
    y = NULL,
    title = "Interest rates of Lending Club loans"
  ) +
  theme( #<<
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), #<<
    axis.text.y = element_blank() #<<
  ) #<<
```
]
]

---

## Adding a categorical variable

.pull-left[
```{r ref.label = "box-cat", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE,out.width = "100%"}
```
]
.pull-right[.small[
```{r box-cat, fig.show = "hide", warning = FALSE}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = interest_rate,
                  y = grade)) + #<<
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    x = "Interest rate (%)",
    y = "Grade",
    title = "Interest rates of Lending Club loans",
    subtitle = "by grade of loan" #<<
  )
```

## Bar plot



```{r stars,include=FALSE }
starwars <- starwars %>%
  mutate(hair_color2 =
           fct_other(hair_color,
                     keep = c("black", 
                              "brown", "brown",
                              "blond")
           )
  )
```


```{r out.width="55%"}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = gender)) +
  geom_bar()
```

---

## Segmented bar plot: counts

```{r out.width="55%"}

ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = gender, 
                  fill = hair_color))+ #<<
  geom_bar()

```

---



## Segmented bar plots

```{r out.width="55%"}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = gender, 
	   fill = hair_color2))+ #<<
  geom_bar()
```


---
# For the curious...

```{r ref.label = "stars", echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE}
```

---

## Segmented bar plots

```{r out.width="55%"}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = gender, 
	   fill = hair_color2))+ #<<
  geom_bar()+ #<<
  coord_flip()
```

---

## Segmented bar plots: proportions

```{r out.width="43%"}
ggplot(data = starwars,
       mapping = aes(x = gender, fill = hair_color2)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  coord_flip()
labs(y = "proportion")
```


---

.question[
    Which bar plot is a more useful representation for visualizing the relationship between gender and hair color?
  ]

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = gender, 
                  fill = hair_color2)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip()
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = gender, 
                  fill = hair_color2)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(y = "proportion")
```
]

---

## Customizing bar plots

We have flexibility in customizing bar plots by adjusting labels, titles, colors, and other visual properties.

.pull-left[
```{r ref.label = "bar-custom", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
```
]
.pull-right[.small[
```{r bar-custom, fig.show = "hide", warning = FALSE}
ggplot(starwars, aes(y = gender, #<<
                  fill = hair_color2)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs( #<<
    x = "Proportion", #<<
    y = "Gender", #<<
    fill = "Hair Color", #<<
    title = "Hair Colors of Starwars", #<<
    subtitle = "by gender" #<<
  ) #<<
```
