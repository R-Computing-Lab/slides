# Introduction to Visualizing Data

## Terminology and Overview

In this session, we will delve into the fascinating world of data visualization. But first, let's go over a few terms:

- Univariate data analysis - distribution of single variable
- Bivariate data analysis - relationship between two variables
- Multivariate data analysis - relationship between many variables at once, usually focusing on the relationship between two while conditioning for others

Variables can be **Numerical** (classified as **continuous** or **discrete**) or **Categorical** (determined as **ordinal** or not based on the natural ordering of levels).

# Our Data Source: The Lending Club

## Data: Lending Club

.pull-left-wide[

We'll be exploring a dataset derived from the Lending Club platform, a service that facilitates loans between individuals. The ease of obtaining a loan here often depends on one's apparent ability to repay the loan. Note that our data represents loans that were actually made, not merely applied for.

.pull-right-narrow[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}

## A Glimpse at the Data

We'll start by getting a brief overview of our dataset. 

```{r output.lines=15}
library(openintro)
glimpse(loans_full_schema)
```

We then select a subset of variables that are particularly relevant for our exploration:

```{r}
loans <- loans_full_schema %>%
  select(loan_amount, interest_rate, term, grade, 
         state, annual_income, homeownership, debt_to_income)
glimpse(loans)
```

Here's a brief description of these variables:

## Variable Descriptions and Types

.midi[
variable        | description    | type
----------------|----------------|-------------
`loan_amount`   |	Amount of the loan received, in US dollars | numerical, continuous
`interest_rate` |	Interest rate on the loan, in an annual percentage | numerical, continuous
`term`	        | The length of the loan, which is always set as a whole number of months | numerical, discrete
`grade`	        | Loan grade, which takes a values A through G and represents the quality of the loan and its likelihood of being repaid | categorical, ordinal
`state`         |	US state where the borrower resides | categorical, not ordinal
`annual_income` |	Borrowerâ€™s annual income, including any second income, in US dollars | numerical, continuous
`homeownership`	| Indicates whether the person owns, owns but has a mortgage, or rents | categorical, not ordinal
`debt_to_income` | Debt-to-income ratio | numerical, continuous

# Visualizing Numerical Data



Before we jump into visualizing numerical data, let's take a moment to discuss why it's important. Numerical data visualization allows us to see patterns, trends, and distributions in data. They provide a graphical representation of data which helps in understanding complex data easily. Let's start with Histograms.

---

## Histogram: `loan_amount`

```{r}
ggplot(data = loans) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = loan_amount), bins = 30, fill = "darkblue", color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Loan Amount", y = "Count", title = "Distribution of Loan Amounts")
```

Histograms are useful to understand the distribution of continuous numerical data. Here, the `loan_amount` variable has been divided into 30 equally sized bins and the number of observations in each bin is represented by the height of the bar.

*Take-home point:* Use histograms to quickly visualize and understand the distribution of a single continuous numerical variable.

## Density Plot: `interest_rate`

```{r}
ggplot(data = loans) +
  geom_density(mapping = aes(x = interest_rate), fill = "darkblue") +
  labs(x = "Interest Rate", y = "Density", title = "Density Plot of Interest Rates")
```

Density plots are similar to histograms in that they describe the distribution of the continuous numerical data. They provide a smoothed curve and it's a good way to visualize data when you have a lot of data points.

*Take-home point:* Use density plots for a smoother and more precise visualization of the distribution of a single continuous numerical variable.

# Visualizing Categorical Data

Now that we have covered numerical data visualization, let's transition to visualizing categorical data. Categorical data are variables that can be divided into multiple categories but having no order or priority. They're often non-numeric and are sometimes called 'factors'. We will start with a Bar plot.

---

## Bar plot: `grade`

```{r}
ggplot(data = loans) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = grade), fill = "darkblue") +
  labs(x = "Grade", y = "Count", title = "Bar Plot of Loan Grades")
```

Bar plots are very common and useful in visualizing categorical data. They represent the counts of unique categories of a factor variable.

*Take-home point:* Use bar plots to quickly visualize and understand the distribution of a single categorical variable.

## Wrapping Up

To summarize:

- We've looked at different ways to visualize both numerical and categorical data, including histograms, density plots, and bar plots.
- We've seen that the choice of visualization often depends on what we're interested in learning about the data.
- And we've used the ggplot2 library in R to generate these visualizations.

Remember, the best way to understand data is to visualize it, and ggplot2 is a powerful tool for doing so.
