#  Exploring Our Data: What is in a dataset?

## Dataset terminology

- Each row is an **observation**
- Each column is a **variable**

## What's in the Star Wars data?

Take a `glimpse` at the data:
.medi[
```{r}
glimpse(starwars)
```
]
---

.question[
How many rows and columns does this dataset have?
What does each row represent?
What does each column represent?
]

```{r eval = FALSE}
?starwars
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/starwars-help.png")
```

.question[
How many rows and columns does this dataset have?
]

.pull-left[
```{r}
nrow(starwars) # number of rows
ncol(starwars) # number of columns
dim(starwars)  # dimensions (row column)
```

## Mass vs. height

.question[ 
How would you describe the relationship between mass and height of Starwars characters?
What other variables would help us understand data points that don't follow the overall trend?
Who is the not so tall but really chubby character?
]

```{r fig.width = 8, warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height of Starwars characters",
       x = "Height (cm)", y = "Weight (kg)") +
  geom_point(data = starwars %>% filter(name == "Jabba Desilijic Tiure"), size = 5, pch = 1, color = "pink", stroke = 3)
```

## Jabba!

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, cache = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
jabba <- image_read("img/jabba.png")

fig <- image_graph(width = 1600, height = 900, res = 200)
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +

       x = "Height (cm)", y = "Weight (kg)") +

dev.off()

out <- fig %>% image_composite(jabba, offset = "+1000+30")

image_write(out, "img/jabbaplot.png", format = "png")
knitr::include_graphics("img/jabbaplot.png")
```

## Mass vs. height

```{r mass-height, fig.width = 8, out.width = "50%"}

  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height of Starwars characters",
       x = "Height (cm)", y = "Weight (kg)")
```

.question[ 
- What are the functions doing the plotting?
- What is the dataset being plotted?
- Which variables map to which features (aesthetics) of the plot?
- What does the warning mean?<sup>+</sup>
]

```{r ref.label="mass-height", fig.show = "hide"}
