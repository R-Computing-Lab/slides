<!-- Neuroscience and psychology courses often present neurodevelopmental disorders through a deficit-based lens, reinforcing stigma and framing conditions such as ADHD and autism as disorders of dysfunction rather than as variations in neurocognitive processing. This framing, which centers pathology and dysfunction, fails to account for neurodivergent perspectives and intersectional barriers that shape lived experiences (Sinclair, 1993; Kapp, 2020). Moreover, it alienates students with neurodivergent identities by implicitly framing their cognitive and emotional experiences as deviations from a neurotypical norm rather than as variations within human diversity (Singer, 1999).
Building on prior work that critiques how psychology curricula reinforce stigma in the teaching of psychiatric conditions (Navarre, Uliaszek, & Garrison, under revision),  this presentation proposes a disability-informed, anti-ableist framework for teaching neurodevelopmental disorders. This framework is rooted in critical disability studies (CDS; Minich, 2016; Schalk, 2017 ) and the neurodiversity paradigm (Singer, 1999; Walker, 2021), emphasizing that the challenges faced by neurodivergent individuals are not inherent deficits but arise from systemic barriers, social invalidation, and lack of accessibility in educational and clinical settings.
We will explore how similar approaches can transform how neurodevelopmental conditions are taught in neuroscience and psychology classrooms. This talk will: (1) illustrate how conventional pedagogical tools can perpetuate harmful stereotypes, (2) examine the impact of language and representation in shaping student perceptions, and (3) propose concrete strategies for integrating inclusive, disability-affirming frameworks into teaching.
By implementing these strategies, neuroscience educators can disrupt structural ableism and create a curriculum that is more inclusive, representative, and accessible to all students, particularly those who are neurodivergent. This approach reshapes the understanding of neurodevelopmental variation from a stigmatizing disorder model to a complex interaction of neurological, social, and cultural factors, ensuring that students are equipped with a nuanced and ethically responsible framework for engaging with neurodivergence.

- A neuroscience student sees their own ADHD brain highlighted in red on a slide labeled "dysfunction."
- A blind student listens to a neuroanatomy lecture where every description assumes vision.
- A d/Deaf student reads a textbook that never mentions sign language as a valid communication mode.

My name is S. Mason Garrison, and I'm from Wake Forest University.  I'm here today to talk about how we teach neurodevelopmental disabilities—and I'm bringing three perspectives to this conversation. First, as someone who teaches data visualization, I spend a lot of time thinking about how our visual and linguistic choices shape understanding. Second, although I'm trained as a quantitative psychologist, I dabble in disability studies, which has taught me to question assumptions about whose minds and bodies we design for. And third, I'm neurodivergent myself, which means I have lived experience navigating systems that weren't built for brains like mine. Today I want to show you how we can teach the same rigorous neuroscience in ways that affirm rather than stigmatize human neurological variation.

I want to talk with you about how we might teach neurodevelopmental conditions in ways that are more inclusive, more accurate, and less stigmatizing. The core of this talk focuses on ADHD, autism, and related conditions, but I want to suggest that the neurodiversity paradigm invites us to think more broadly—about sensory differences like blindness and Deafness, about alternative communication methods, about the full spectrum of human neurological variation. As educators, the language we use, the examples we give, the way we visualize brain differences—all of this profoundly shapes what our students take away, not just about neuroscience, but about the value and belonging of neurodivergent people.

## The Hidden Lesson Plan

<!-- Slide 2: What current approaches actually teach -->

When neuroscience courses use deficit language and pathologizing visuals, students learn:

--
.pull-left.medi[
.hand-blue[About neurodivergent people:]
- Different brains = broken brains
- Neurodivergence = medical problem
- Support = pity or burden
- Accommodation = special treatment

.hand-blue[About science:]
- One brain pattern = optimal
- Difference = dysfunction
- Visual learning is presumed universal
- Intervention goal = normalization
- Accommodation = exception, not design
]
???

Script: Before we talk about solutions, let's acknowledge what our current approaches actually teach. When every brain image highlights deficits in red, when every example focuses on dysfunction, when every intervention aims to normalize—we're teaching a hidden curriculum about worth, belonging, and scientific authority. Students learn that difference equals deficiency, that their own brains might be problems to solve rather than minds capable of doing science. This isn't intentional, but it's systematic. And it has real consequences for who stays in our fields and who feels welcome in our classrooms.
--
.pull-right[
.hand-blue.big[About themselves:]
- "My brain isn't normal"
- "My learning needs are problems"
- "I'm the test subject, not the scientist"
- "I need 'special' help to belong here"

.big[This hidden curriculum is more powerful than anything in our syllabi]

<!-- Slide 3: Clear roadmap -->
.large[
1. **Problem**: How conventional tools reinforce narrow models of ability  
2. **Transformation**: A detailed before/after case study showing the same content reframed
3. **Solution**: Systematic strategies for inclusive, disability-affirming pedagogy
4. **Implementation**: Concrete steps you can take this week, this month, this semester
]
--
**Goal**: Leave with tools you can use immediately to make your neuroscience teaching more inclusive

???

Script: Here's where we're headed. First, I'll show you exactly how conventional teaching tools embed deficit assumptions—even when we think we're being neutral. Then I'll walk through a detailed transformation of actual course content, showing you the same neuroscience presented two different ways. Next, we'll systematize this into concrete strategies you can apply across your teaching. Finally, I'll give you a practical implementation timeline so you can start making changes immediately. My goal is that you leave with specific tools, not just good intentions.

# The Problem with Deficit Framing

- Psychology and neuroscience courses often present neurodevelopmental disorders as deficits.
- This framing implies dysfunction, brokenness, and deviation from a supposed norm.
- Conditions like ADHD and autism are portrayed as problems to be fixed.
- Sensory disabilities like blindness are portrayed as problems to be accommodated.
- This reinforces stigma and ignores the lived experience of disabled people.

???
<!-- Slide 2: Deficit framing -->
Script: As a quantitative psychologist who teaches data visualization, I spend a lot of time thinking about how we present information—and what messages our visual choices send. But I also bring lived experience as a neurodivergent person to this conversation, which gives me a different lens on how deficit framing actually impacts students. When I look at neuroscience teaching materials, I see the same patterns I've studied in my own field: data visualizations that embed value judgments. Those fMRI slides with "reduced activation" highlighted in red? From a data viz perspective, that's a design choice that implies "less = bad." 

In most neuroscience and psychology classrooms, neurodevelopmental conditions are taught using what’s often called a “deficit model.” That is: we treat ADHD and autism as disorders — breakdowns in executive function, or in social reciprocity, or in attention. We show fMRI slides with red areas indicating "reduced activation." We diagram neural pathways as "impaired" or "dysfunctional." We present connectivity matrices highlighting "disrupted networks."

# What Counts as Difference?

## And what the heck is neurodiversity, anyway?

.pull-left[
- Neurodiversity is a lens that recognizes cognitive and behavioral variation as part of human diversity.
- It includes cognitive, sensory, and communicative variation.
- Not limited to psychiatric or learning diagnoses.
- Includes blindness, Deafness, alternative speech, sensory processing differences.
- The literature on neurodiversity emphasizes strengths and differences rather than deficits.
]
.pull-right[
- __It challenges us to reframe our understanding of what is "normal" and to value diverse ways of being.__
- Places like the Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN) and the Neurodiversity Hub advocate for this perspective.
- Scholars like Nick Walker (Neuroqueer Heresies) and Steven Kapp (Neurodiversity in Higher Education) contribute to this discourse by highlighting the importance of neurodiversity in education and society.
]
???

Script: When we talk about diversity in cognition or behavior, we often start with diagnostic categories: ADHD, autism, dyslexia. But those aren’t the only kinds of differences that matter. Visual processing, sensory balance, tactile interpretation, alternative communication methods — these are all part of human variation. A neurodiversity lens asks us to treat all of these not as exceptions or impairments, but as ways of being. And it asks us to notice when curricula center just one way of perceiving, thinking, or moving through the world.

# What Counts as Difference?

## And what the heck is neurodiversity, anyway?

## How Teaching Tools Embed Narrow Assumptions

<!-- Slide 4: Consolidated problem identification -->

.pull-left[
__Visual Design That Excludes__
- All brain images assume visual access
- fMRI slides with "decreased activation" in alarming red
- Complex diagrams without tactile or auditory alternatives
- Color-only coding that excludes colorblind students
- Anatomical models only available visually
]
???

Script: Let me show you how deficit thinking gets embedded in our teaching materials. As someone who teaches data visualization, I notice that neuroscience education makes design choices that encode judgments about the data. Red highlighting for brain differences implies danger or deficiency. Language like "impaired pathways" locates problems in individuals rather than systems. These choices seem scientifically neutral, but they're not. They teach students that different brain patterns are broken brain patterns. And this matters because many of our students have these same brain patterns—we're teaching them that they're fundamentally flawed.
--
.pull-right[
__Language That Pathologizes__
- "Blindness causes learning difficulties" (assumes visual learning is standard)
- "ADHD students struggle with attention" (locates problem in person)
- "Autism involves communication deficits" (centers neurotypical communication)
- "Normal brain" vs "disabled brain" comparisons
]

---

## How Teaching Tools Embed Narrow Assumptions

.pull-left[
## Curricular Assumptions
**Most materials presume:**
- Sighted, hearing, speaking students
- Neurotypical processing speeds and styles
- Verbal/auditory communication as default
- Visual learning as universal
- Standard classroom environments work for everyone

- **Students who navigate differently are treated as exceptions**
- **We rarely ask: What if we designed for all kinds of minds and bodies from the start?**

# CASE STUDY: Neuroanatomy Transformation

## BEFORE: Deficit/Visual-Only Model

.pull-left[
**Teaching Brain Structure**
- "Normal visual cortex vs. abnormal in blindness"
- Complex visual diagrams with no alternatives
- "Deaf students have auditory processing deficits"
- "ADHD shows prefrontal dysfunction"
- Assumes all students access information visually
- Communication = verbal speech only
]

```

*Result: Blind, d/Deaf, neurodivergent students learn their brains are broken*

---


## AFTER: Inclusive Variation Model
.pull-left[

**Teaching Brain Structure as Adaptive Variation**
- "Visual cortex shows alternative organization in blindness, with enhanced processing in other regions"
- Multiple formats: tactile models, audio descriptions, visual diagrams
- "Deaf brains show efficient visual-spatial processing networks"
- "ADHD represents alternative attention regulation patterns"
- Information available through multiple sensory channels
]

.pull-right[

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="95%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/morenice.png")

```

]

**Same neuroscience, radically different message about human worth**
???

Script: Here's what transformation looks like in practice. Same research findings, same brain imaging data, but presented through two different frameworks. The deficit model on the left locates problems in the individual brain—everything is broken, impaired, abnormal. The neurodiversity model on the right treats the same patterns as organizational differences that might need different supports. Notice I haven't changed the science—the research is identical. But I have changed the framing, the language, and the visual design. And that changes everything about what students learn.

## What Changed and Why It Matters

### Specific Changes Made
.pull-left[

- "Abnormal" → "Pattern B"
- "Deficit" → "Different strategies"
- "Treatment" → "Support"

.pull-right[
**Visual shifts:**
- Red alarm colors → Neutral purple
- "Reduced" → "Pattern B"
- Comparison to norm → Variation within range

**Conceptual shifts:**
- Problem in person → Person-environment interaction
- Fix the brain → Optimize the system
]
???

Script: Let's analyze exactly what I changed and why it produces different outcomes. The language shifts are systematic—every deficit term becomes a difference term. The visual shifts matter enormously—red signals danger while blue signals interesting variation. But the biggest change is conceptual: we've moved from a medical model that locates problems in individuals to an ecological model that examines person-environment interactions. And this produces measurable changes in student behavior. When I piloted this approach, students told me it was the first time they'd seen their brains discussed without shame. More importantly, they started participating, self-advocating, and pursuing research in the field instead of leaving it.

### Why This Matters

**From my teaching experience:**
- Students respond differently when differences aren't presented as deficits
- Language changes how students think about accommodation requests
- Neurodiversity-informed approaches reduce resistance to support

**This aligns with broader inclusive pedagogy research showing representation affects belonging**

# Systematic Solution 1: Universal Design Framework

---

# Universal Design Framework
- Proactively designing course materials to be accessible to all students, regardless of their sensory or cognitive processing styles.
- Incorporating multiple means of representation, engagement, and expression in all aspects of teaching.
- Continuously assessing and iterating on course design based on student feedback and diverse needs.
???

Script: Now let's systematize this approach. Universal Design for Learning provides a framework for building variation into your courses from the beginning. The key insight is that when you design for students at the margins—blind students, deaf students, neurodivergent students—you actually improve the experience for everyone. Captions help not just deaf students but also students in noisy environments. Multiple assessment formats help not just students with learning differences but also students with different strengths. This isn't about lowering standards—it's about providing multiple pathways to demonstrate the same rigorous learning.

# Systematic Solution 2: Language and Visual Design

<!-- Slide 8: Concrete language/visual guidelines -->
## Language Audit Framework
.pull-left[
**Systematic replacements:**
- "Impairment" → "difference"

Second, does this language center pathology or the whole person? For visuals, remember that design choices encode values. When you consistently use red for brain differences, you're teaching students that difference equals danger. When you use neutral scientific colors, you're teaching them that difference equals variation. Both approaches are scientifically valid—but only one is ethically responsible.

# Systematic Solution 3: Inclusive Neuroscience Strategies

---

<!-- Slide 9: Field-specific implementations for all kinds of variation -->
## For All Neurological Content

- Describe all brain images aloud (benefits blind and visual processing differences)
- Present patterns as "Typical/Atypical" not "normal/abnormal"
- Provide information through multiple sensory channels
- Include tactile models and audio alternatives
- Use consistent, accessible color schemes
- Show individual variation within neurotypes
???

Script: Here are specific strategies for neuroscience education. In neuroanatomy, don't just show the brain—describe it aloud for students who can't see or prefer auditory processing. In neuropharmacology, frame medications as optimization tools rather than fixes for broken brains. In research methods, question your assumptions about control groups and normal populations. The goal isn't to water down the science—it's to remove barriers that prevent students from accessing and demonstrating their neuroscience knowledge. These changes benefit everyone, not just disabled students.
---

## For Sensory & Perceptual Systems
- Frame blindness as enhanced neural plasticity, not "loss"
- Present Deafness as cultural/linguistic variation, not deficit
- Discuss sensory processing differences as variations in threshold and integration
- Include examples of how different sensory profiles contribute to scientific discovery
???

## For Lab Work & Assessment
- Multiple partnership configurations (some work better alone, some in pairs)
- Instructions available in visual, auditory, and written formats
- Alternative ways to record observations?
- Labs accessible to different mobility and sensory profiles

- Address accessibility in recruitment and data collection
- Recognize that cognitive diversity improves research quality

Script: The long-term vision extends far beyond your individual classroom. When you teach neuroscience through a neurodiversity lens, you're training the next generation of researchers, clinicians, and educators. Students who learn that difference doesn't equal deficit become doctors who listen to disabled patients, researchers who question ableist assumptions, and teachers who design for inclusion from the start. This is how systemic change happens—one classroom, one student, one reframed slide at a time.

# Addressing Common Concerns

<!-- Slide 12: Constructive responses to pushback -->
---


## "This sounds like a lot of extra work"
- **Reality:** Universal design reduces individual accommodation requests
- **Data point:** Students can access materials independently, reducing faculty workload
- **Commentary:** Also pays off when that accommodation request comes in
- **Efficiency gain:** Clear structure and multiple formats help all students learn better

---

## "What about maintaining academic rigor?"
- **Key insight:** Rigor = high expectations + appropriate support
- **Evidence:** Accessibility increases engagement without lowering standards
- **Reframe:** Are we measuring neuroscience knowledge or test-taking ability?

---

## "How do I assess fairly if everyone gets different formats?"
- **Core principle:** Fair ≠ identical; fair = equitable access to demonstrate knowledge
- **Better question:** Do my assessments measure what I want them to measure?
- **Research finding:** Multiple measures provide better data about student learning

---

## "What if students take advantage of accommodations?"
- **Response:** Students generally request what they need, not what they want
- **Flip the question:** What if we trusted students to know their own learning needs?
- **Outcome:** Self-advocacy skills that benefit students throughout their careers

???
Script: I get these questions every time I present this material, and I understand the concerns. Change feels risky, especially when you're responsible for rigorous scientific training. But let me reframe these as design challenges rather than obstacles. When faculty worry about extra work, I show them that well-designed accessible courses actually reduce their workload because students can access materials independently. When they worry about rigor, I remind them that rigor isn't standardization—it's clarity plus support. And when they worry about students taking advantage, I ask: what would our field look like if we trusted students to know their own learning needs?

# What Students Learn Instead


<!-- Slide 13: Positive outcomes for all kinds of neurological variation -->

## About Human Neurological Variation
- Difference is natural and expected across all dimensions
- Blindness involves neural plasticity and enhanced processing
- Deafness includes rich cultural and linguistic traditions
- Neurodivergence contributes valuable perspectives to science
- Alternative communication methods are fully legitimate
- Environmental barriers often create "disability," not the person
???

Script: When you change how you teach neuroscience, you change what students learn—not just about content, but about themselves and their field. Students learn that their brains have value in scientific spaces, that difference contributes to rather than detracts from rigorous inquiry, that accommodation is optimization rather than special treatment. They also learn practical skills: how to design inclusive research, how to create accessible clinical environments, how to build professional cultures that welcome rather than merely tolerate human variation. These students become the scientists, clinicians, and educators who transform our fields from the inside out.
---

## About Science and Discovery
- Multiple approaches strengthen scientific inquiry
- Cognitive and sensory diversity improve research teams
- Questioning assumptions is fundamental to discovery
- Human variation is scientifically fascinating, not problematic
- Accessibility and rigor are completely compatible

Script: I don't want you to leave here with just good intentions—I want you to have concrete tools. If I weren't writing my tenure dossier right now (and running for being a wikipedia admin), I would have made some templates and resources available for you....

But beyond individual change, we need systemic transformation. That means connecting with colleagues, advocating for policy changes, and building communities of practice around inclusive education. It means taking seriously student feedback about what works and what doesn't. And it means understanding that this is ongoing work, not a one-time fix.

# The Bigger Picture

<!-- Slide 15: Implications for the field -->

When we teach neurodevelopmental differences through a neurodiversity lens:

.pull-left[
### We transform who does science
- More neurodivergent students stay in STEM
- Graduate programs become more accessible
- Research teams include cognitive diversity
- Clinical practice centers patient expertise
]
.pull-right[
## We transform how science is done
- Research questions reflect diverse perspectives
- Study designs account for human variation
- Findings are interpreted through multiple lenses
- Applications benefit broader populations
]
---


## We transform what science discovers
- Moving beyond deficit models reveals new insights
- Participatory research yields richer data
- Intersectional approaches capture complexity
- Innovation emerges from cognitive diversity
--

**Today's inclusive classroom becomes tomorrow's inclusive profession**


???

Script: This work is about more than making individual students feel welcome—though that matters enormously. It's about transforming who gets to do science, how science gets done, and what science discovers. When more neurodivergent people stay in neuroscience, we ask different research questions. When we include disabled people as collaborators rather than subjects, we get better data. When we design for cognitive diversity, we create innovations that benefit everyone. The students sitting in your classroom today will become the researchers, clinicians, and educators of tomorrow. What they learn about difference, dignity, and belonging will shape the future of our fields.

# Summary: From Deficit to Design

<!-- Slide 16: Clear takeaways -->

.pull-left[
## What we've covered
1. **Problem**: Conventional neuroscience teaching embeds deficit thinking through language and visuals

2. **Transformation**: The same rigorous content can be presented to affirm rather than stigmatize neurological differences

3. **Solutions**: Systematic approaches (UDL, language audits, inclusive assessment) that benefit all students

4. **Implementation**: Concrete steps you can take this week, this month, and this semester
]
--
.pull-right[
## Key principles
- **Design for variation, not exceptions**
- **Use neutral language for neurological differences**
- **Create multiple pathways to demonstrate knowledge**  
- **Center student voices in curriculum decisions**
- **Build accessibility into planning, not as afterthought**
---

## Bottom line
**Inclusive neuroscience education doesn't compromise rigor—it extends rigor to more minds**

???

Script: Let me summarize what we've covered. We started with the problem: how conventional teaching tools embed deficit assumptions that harm students. We walked through a detailed transformation showing how the same neuroscience can be presented differently. We systematized this into concrete strategies you can implement immediately. And we talked about the bigger picture—how inclusive education transforms not just individual experiences but entire fields. The bottom line is this: inclusive neuroscience education doesn't compromise rigor—it extends rigor to more minds.

---

## Your Next Steps

<!-- Slide 17: Concrete call to action -->

### This week
Choose ONE slide from your most-used lecture and audit it for deficit language

### This month  
Implement ONE change: try describing brain images aloud, use neutral colors, or offer one assessment option

### This semester
Design ONE course component with accessibility in mind from the start

---

## Start small, think systemically
- **Language audit**: Count deficit words in your top 5 slides
- **Visual review**: Replace red highlighting with neutral colors  
- **Student check-in**: Ask what would help them learn better
- **Colleague conversation**: Share one thing you learned today

**Remember: Small changes create ripple effects that extend far beyond your classroom**

???

Script: I want to end with specific commitments you can make right now. Don't wait until you have time to overhaul your entire curriculum—start with one slide this week. Choose one systematic change this month. Design one course component this semester with inclusion in mind from the beginning. And before you leave, scan this QR code to access all the resources I've mentioned: templates, checklists, examples, and implementation guides. Small changes compound into transformative impact, but only if you start.
