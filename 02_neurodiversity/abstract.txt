Teaching Neurodevelopmental Disabilities Through a Neurodiversity Lens: Addressing Stereotypes, Representation, and Inclusion

Neuroscience and psychology courses often present neurodevelopmental disorders through a deficit-based lens, reinforcing stigma and framing conditions such as ADHD and autism as disorders of dysfunction rather than as variations in neurocognitive processing. This framing, which centers pathology and dysfunction, fails to account for neurodivergent perspectives and intersectional barriers that shape lived experiences (Sinclair, 1993; Kapp, 2020). Moreover, it alienates students with neurodivergent identities by implicitly framing their cognitive and emotional experiences as deviations from a neurotypical norm rather than as variations within human diversity (Singer, 1999).
Building on prior work that critiques how psychology curricula reinforce stigma in the teaching of psychiatric conditions (Navarre, Uliaszek, & Garrison, under revision),  this presentation proposes a disability-informed, anti-ableist framework for teaching neurodevelopmental disorders. This framework is rooted in critical disability studies (CDS; Minich, 2016; Schalk, 2017 ) and the neurodiversity paradigm (Singer, 1999; Walker, 2021), emphasizing that the challenges faced by neurodivergent individuals are not inherent deficits but arise from systemic barriers, social invalidation, and lack of accessibility in educational and clinical settings.
We will explore how similar approaches can transform how neurodevelopmental conditions are taught in neuroscience and psychology classrooms. This talk will: (1) illustrate how conventional pedagogical tools can perpetuate harmful stereotypes, (2) examine the impact of language and representation in shaping student perceptions, and (3) propose concrete strategies for integrating inclusive, disability-affirming frameworks into teaching.
By implementing these strategies, neuroscience educators can disrupt structural ableism and create a curriculum that is more inclusive, representative, and accessible to all students, particularly those who are neurodivergent. This approach reshapes the understanding of neurodevelopmental variation from a stigmatizing disorder model to a complex interaction of neurological, social, and cultural factors, ensuring that students are equipped with a nuanced and ethically responsible framework for engaging with neurodivergence.
