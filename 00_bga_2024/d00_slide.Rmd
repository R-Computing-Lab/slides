<!-- The adage 'A picture is worth a thousand words' is just as applicable to Behavior Genetics as it is to journalism. In this talk, I delve into the rich diverse history of data visualization techniques in the field of behavior genetics, tracing advancements from Wright's [@Wright1920] classic path diagram of guinea pigs to the contemporary usage of Manhattan plots. This survey sets the stage for the development of two resources aimed at bolstering the field's visualization toolkit. The first, an atlas employing 'ggplot2' in R, aims to guide researchers in selecting the most appropriate visualization techniques for their data. The second, a proposed R package, seeks to facilitate the integration of 'OpenMx'-compatible visualizations, streamlining the presentation of complex genetic analyses. Emphasizing practical advice, the talk will cover effective uses of path diagrams, family trees, and interaction visualizations, with the goal of improving clarity and interpretability of genetic data. This initiative aspires to democratize advanced data visualization tools, making them more accessible to the behavior genetics community and, in turn, amplifying the impact and reach of its research. -->

# Hello world!

<!-- Slide 1: Introduction (1 minute) -->
<!-- Script: Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone. My name is S. Mason Garrison, and I'm from Wake Forest University. Today, I'm excited to talk about the importance of data visualization in the field of behavior genetics. As the saying goes, "A picture is worth a thousand words." This is particularly true in our field, where complex data can be better understood through effective visualization techniques. -->

# The Power of Visualization


### "A picture is worth a thousand words."

Visualizations in behavior genetics:
- Facilitate understanding of complex data.
- Reveal patterns and relationships not obvious from raw data.
- Enable more effective communication of research findings.


<!-- Slide 2: The Power of Visualization (1 minute) -->
<!-- Script: The adage "A picture is worth a thousand words" is just as applicable to Behavior Genetics as it is to journalism. Visualizing data helps us to see patterns, relationships, and insights that might not be immediately apparent from raw numbers alone. Today, I will take you through the rich and diverse history of data visualization techniques in behavior genetics, from early methods to contemporary applications. -->

## Alternative Talk

I could have spent this talk showing you some of the cool visualizations I've made since the last conference...

---

# Like This One


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/X chroms.png")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mtdna.png")
```

---

# Or these!

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align='center'}
#knitr::include_graphics("path_diagram_image_url")
```

---

# Or even my latest creation!

That's extremely promising for making much better pedigrees plots...

But... well... It's not what I'm going to do today.

But I decided to focus on the history of data visualization in behavior genetics. I'll show you some of the cool visualizations I've made in the workshop.

## Wright's Path Diagram (1920)

- Sewall Wright's path diagrams were pioneering tools for illustrating genetic relationships.
- Enabled the visualization of complex genetic interactions and pathways.
- Revolutionized genetic research by providing a clear, visual method for understanding heritability and genetic correlations.

---

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align='center'}
#knitr::include_graphics("path_diagram_image_url")
```

<!-- Slide 3: Historical Context (1 minute) -->
<!-- Script: One of the earliest and most significant contributions to data visualization in genetics was Wright's Path Diagram, introduced in 1920. This diagram allowed researchers to visually represent the relationships between genetic traits and their underlying factors, revolutionizing how we interpret genetic data. -->

# Modern Techniques


## Modern Path Diagrams

- Modern path diagrams are used in structural equation modeling (SEM).

- Visualize complex relationships between variables in a statistical model.

- Help researchers understand the direct and indirect effects of variables on each other.

---

# Classic path diagrams can start to resemble the wiring of a computer or a military aircraft.

# Bomber

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align='center'}
#knitr::include_graphics("path_diagram_image_url")
```   

# Cute little path diagram

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align='center'}

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align='center'}
#knitr::include_graphics("manhattan_plot_image_url")
```

### Manhattan Plots

- Widely used in genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
- Plot p-values for genetic variants across the genome.
- Help identify regions of the genome associated with traits or diseases.
- Visualize large-scale genetic data, making it easier to detect significant associations.

<!-- Slide 4: Modern Techniques (1 minute) -->
<!-- Script: Moving to modern times, the Manhattan Plot has become a staple in genetic research, particularly for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). These plots help researchers identify significant genetic variants by visualizing p-values across the genome, making it easier to spot areas of interest. -->

# Importance of Good Graphs for Science Communication

## Case Study: Misinterpretation of Genetic Data
.pull-left[
- A figure in a high-profile Nature paper raised concerns about reinforcing racist beliefs.
- The UMAP generated figure aimed to show genetic diversity but was misinterpreted as supporting genetic essentialism.
- Highlights the need for careful design and interpretation of scientific figures.

.pull-right[
```{r, nature_figure, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Genomic data in the All of Us Research Program.jpg")
```
]


<!-- But a problem with using UMAP, Pritchard wrote, is that it can exaggerate the distinctiveness of populations and fail to represent their intermixing properly. -->
---

## Lessons Learned
.pull-left[
- Good graphs should accurately represent data without misleading the audience.
- Consider the potential for misinterpretation and strive for clarity.
- Use visualizations to enhance understanding and communication of scientific findings.

<!-- Slide 7: Importance of Good Graphs (2 minutes) -->
<!-- Script: This example underscores the importance of good graphs in science communication. A recent Nature article included a figure that was misinterpreted, leading to concerns about reinforcing racist beliefs. The chart aimed to show genetic diversity but ended up being misinterpreted as supporting genetic essentialism. This highlights the need for careful design and interpretation of scientific figures to ensure accurate and responsible communication of data. Good graphs should accurately represent data without misleading the audience, and researchers must consider the potential for misinterpretation. -->
