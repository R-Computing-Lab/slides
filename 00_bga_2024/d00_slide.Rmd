<!-- The adage 'A picture is worth a thousand words' is just as applicable to Behavior Genetics as it is to journalism. In this talk, I delve into the rich diverse history of data visualization techniques in the field of behavior genetics, tracing advancements from Wright's [@Wright1920] classic path diagram of guinea pigs to the contemporary usage of Manhattan plots. This survey sets the stage for the development of two resources aimed at bolstering the field's visualization toolkit. The first, an atlas employing 'ggplot2' in R, aims to guide researchers in selecting the most appropriate visualization techniques for their data. The second, a proposed R package, seeks to facilitate the integration of 'OpenMx'-compatible visualizations, streamlining the presentation of complex genetic analyses. Emphasizing practical advice, the talk will cover effective uses of path diagrams, family trees, and interaction visualizations, with the goal of improving clarity and interpretability of genetic data. This initiative aspires to democratize advanced data visualization tools, making them more accessible to the behavior genetics community and, in turn, amplifying the impact and reach of its research. -->

# The Power of Visualization



### "A picture is worth a thousand words."

- Visualizations in behavior genetics:
  - Facilitate understanding of complex data.
  - Reveal patterns and relationships not obvious from raw data.
  - Enable more effective communication of research findings.


<!-- Slide 2: The Power of Visualization (1 minute) -->
<!-- Script: The adage "A picture is worth a thousand words" is just as applicable to Behavior Genetics as it is to journalism. Visualizing data helps us to see patterns, relationships, and insights that might not be immediately apparent from raw numbers alone. Today, I will take you through the rich and diverse history of data visualization techniques in behavior genetics, from early methods to contemporary applications. -->

# Historical Context

## Wright's Path Diagram (1920)

- Sewall Wright's path diagrams were pioneering tools for illustrating genetic relationships.
- Enabled the visualization of complex genetic interactions and pathways.
- Revolutionized genetic research by providing a clear, visual method for understanding heritability and genetic correlations.

<!-- Slide 4: Wright's Adaptive Landscape Diagram (2 minutes) 
This chapter traces the origins and conceptual lineages of the adaptive landscape concept and its representations. While Armand Janet's 1895 concept arguably marks the origin of the adaptive landscape concept and even its graphic representation, Janet's concept had very limited impact when compared to Sewall Wright's concept from 1932. As part of his effort to reconcile Mendelian genetics and Darwinian evolution in his shifting balance theory, Wright offered the metaphor of the adaptive landscape and its topographic representation as a way of depicting the effect of variations in population size, migration, and the strength of selection. Wright's genetic version of the adaptive landscape inspired other versions of the adaptive landscape based on phenotypic changes and on molecular changes. As a result, the history of the adaptive landscape is described in terms of three lineages based on the material basis of the adaptive landscape: the genetic landscape, the phenotypic landscape, and the molecular landscape.

<!-- An adaptive landscape, also known as a fitness landscape, is a conceptual model used in evolutionary biology to represent the relationship between genotypes (or phenotypes) and their reproductive success (fitness). This landscape is visualized in a multi-dimensional space, where each point corresponds to a specific genotype (or phenotype), and the height of the landscape at that point represents the fitness associated with that genotype (or phenotype).

Here are the key features and concepts of an adaptive landscape:

Dimensions: Each axis in the landscape represents a different genetic or phenotypic trait. In a simple two-dimensional model, the x and y axes could represent two different traits, while the z-axis represents fitness.

Fitness Peaks and Valleys: High points (peaks) on the landscape represent genotypes or phenotypes with high fitness, while low points (valleys) represent those with low fitness. Organisms are "trying" to climb towards the peaks.

Evolutionary Pathways: The paths organisms take through the landscape depend on mutation, selection, and genetic drift. Evolution tends to move populations up the slopes towards higher fitness, but can be constrained by the landscape's topography.

Ruggedness: The complexity of the landscape is referred to as its ruggedness. A rugged landscape has many peaks and valleys, indicating a complex relationship between genotype and fitness, while a smooth landscape has fewer, more distinct peaks.

Adaptive Peaks: These are the optimal points where an organism has maximum fitness given the current environmental conditions.

Shifting Landscapes: The adaptive landscape can change over time due to changes in the environment, leading to new peaks and valleys and thus new evolutionary pressures.

This concept helps to visualize and understand how populations evolve over time, how they can become trapped on local fitness peaks, and how they might traverse valleys to reach higher peaks through mechanisms like genetic drift or significant environmental changes.

-->
<!-- Script: Wright's adaptive landscape diagram was another groundbreaking visualization, depicting the relationship between genetic variation and fitness. This provided a visual representation of natural selection and evolutionary dynamics. -->

## Modern Path Diagrams

- Modern path diagrams are used in structural equation modeling (SEM).
- Now... they use `r emo::ji('square')`s, `r emo::ji('circle')`s, and `r emo::ji('left arrow')`s to represent variables, relationships, and causal pathways.
- Visualize complex relationships between variables in a statistical model in a way that can be easily interpreted.
- However, they can be challenging to create...

- Provides functions for creating path diagrams, correlation matrices, and other visualizations compatible with the data structures used in `OpenMx`.
- Aims to make advanced visualization tools more accessible to researchers in behavior genetics.
