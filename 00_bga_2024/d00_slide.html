&lt;!-- The adage 'A picture is worth a thousand words' is just as applicable to Behavior Genetics as it is to journalism. In this talk, I delve into the rich diverse history of data visualization techniques in the field of behavior genetics, tracing advancements from Wright's [@Wright1920] classic path diagram of guinea pigs to the contemporary usage of Manhattan plots. This survey sets the stage for the development of two resources aimed at bolstering the field's visualization toolkit. The first, an atlas employing 'ggplot2' in R, aims to guide researchers in selecting the most appropriate visualization techniques for their data. The second, a proposed R package, seeks to facilitate the integration of 'OpenMx'-compatible visualizations, streamlining the presentation of complex genetic analyses. Emphasizing practical advice, the talk will cover effective uses of path diagrams, family trees, and interaction visualizations, with the goal of improving clarity and interpretability of genetic data. This initiative aspires to democratize advanced data visualization tools, making them more accessible to the behavior genetics community and, in turn, amplifying the impact and reach of its research. --&gt;

# The Power of Visualization


### "A picture is worth a thousand words."

Visualizations in behavior genetics:
- Facilitate understanding of complex data.
- Reveal patterns and relationships not obvious from raw data.
- Enable more effective communication of research findings.


&lt;!-- Slide 2: The Power of Visualization (1 minute) --&gt;
&lt;!-- Script: The adage "A picture is worth a thousand words" is just as applicable to Behavior Genetics as it is to journalism. Visualizing data helps us to see patterns, relationships, and insights that might not be immediately apparent from raw numbers alone. Today, I will take you through the rich and diverse history of data visualization techniques in behavior genetics, from early methods to contemporary applications. --&gt;

## Alternative Talk

I could have spent this talk showing you some of the cool visualizations I've made since the last conference...

---

# Like This One


&lt;img src="img/X chroms.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
&lt;img src="img/mtdna.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Or these!



---

# Or even my latest creation!

That's extremely promising for making much better pedigrees plots...

But... well... It's not what I'm going to do today.

# Importance of Good Graphs for Science Communication

## Case Study: Misinterpretation of Genetic Data
.pull-left[
- A figure in a high-profile Nature paper raised concerns about reinforcing racist beliefs.
- The UMAP generated figure aimed to show genetic diversity but was misinterpreted as supporting genetic essentialism.
- Highlights the need for careful design and interpretation of scientific figures.

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="img/Genomic data in the All of Us Research Program.jpg" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]


&lt;!-- But a problem with using UMAP, Pritchard wrote, is that it can exaggerate the distinctiveness of populations and fail to represent their intermixing properly. --&gt;
---

## Lessons Learned
.pull-left[
- Good graphs should accurately represent data without misleading the audience.
- Consider the potential for misinterpretation and strive for clarity.
- Use visualizations to enhance understanding and communication of scientific findings.
