&lt;!-- The adage 'A picture is worth a thousand words' is just as applicable to Behavior Genetics as it is to journalism. In this talk, I delve into the rich diverse history of data visualization techniques in the field of behavior genetics, tracing advancements from Wright's [@Wright1920] classic path diagram of guinea pigs to the contemporary usage of Manhattan plots. This survey sets the stage for the development of two resources aimed at bolstering the field's visualization toolkit. The first, an atlas employing 'ggplot2' in R, aims to guide researchers in selecting the most appropriate visualization techniques for their data. The second, a proposed R package, seeks to facilitate the integration of 'OpenMx'-compatible visualizations, streamlining the presentation of complex genetic analyses. Emphasizing practical advice, the talk will cover effective uses of path diagrams, family trees, and interaction visualizations, with the goal of improving clarity and interpretability of genetic data. This initiative aspires to democratize advanced data visualization tools, making them more accessible to the behavior genetics community and, in turn, amplifying the impact and reach of its research. --&gt;

# Hello world!

&lt;!-- Slide 1: Introduction (1 minute) --&gt;
&lt;!-- Script: Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone. My name is S. Mason Garrison, and I'm from Wake Forest University. Today, I'm excited to talk about the importance of data visualization in the field of behavior genetics. As the saying goes, "A picture is worth a thousand words." This is particularly true in our field, where complex data can be better understood through effective visualization techniques. --&gt;

# The Power of Visualization



### "A picture is worth a thousand words."

- Visualizations in behavior genetics:
  - Facilitate understanding of complex data.
  - Reveal patterns and relationships not obvious from raw data.
  - Enable more effective communication of research findings.


&lt;!-- Slide 2: The Power of Visualization (1 minute) --&gt;
&lt;!-- Script: The adage "A picture is worth a thousand words" is just as applicable to Behavior Genetics as it is to journalism. Visualizing data helps us to see patterns, relationships, and insights that might not be immediately apparent from raw numbers alone. Today, I will take you through the rich and diverse history of data visualization techniques in behavior genetics, from early methods to contemporary applications. --&gt;

# Historical Context

---

## Wright's Path Diagram (1920)

- Sewall Wright's path diagrams were pioneering tools for illustrating genetic relationships.
- Enabled the visualization of complex genetic interactions and pathways.
- Revolutionized genetic research by providing a clear, visual method for understanding heritability and genetic correlations.

--

&lt;img src="img/Wright20aFigure5_1.jpg" width="30%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

&lt;!-- Slide 3: Historical Context (1 minute) --&gt;
&lt;!-- Script: One of the earliest and most significant contributions to data visualization in genetics was Wright's Path Diagram, introduced in 1920. This diagram allowed researchers to visually represent the relationships between genetic traits and their underlying factors, revolutionizing how we interpret genetic data. --&gt;

&lt;!-- Slide 4: Wright's Adaptive Landscape Diagram (2 minutes) 
This chapter traces the origins and conceptual lineages of the adaptive landscape concept and its representations. While Armand Janet's 1895 concept arguably marks the origin of the adaptive landscape concept and even its graphic representation, Janet's concept had very limited impact when compared to Sewall Wright's concept from 1932. As part of his effort to reconcile Mendelian genetics and Darwinian evolution in his shifting balance theory, Wright offered the metaphor of the adaptive landscape and its topographic representation as a way of depicting the effect of variations in population size, migration, and the strength of selection. Wright's genetic version of the adaptive landscape inspired other versions of the adaptive landscape based on phenotypic changes and on molecular changes. As a result, the history of the adaptive landscape is described in terms of three lineages based on the material basis of the adaptive landscape: the genetic landscape, the phenotypic landscape, and the molecular landscape.

## Modern Path Diagrams

- Modern path diagrams are used in structural equation modeling (SEM).
- Now... they use ◾s, ⭕s, and ⬅️s to represent variables, relationships, and causal pathways.
- Visualize complex relationships between variables in a statistical model in a way that can be easily interpreted.
- However, they can be challenging to create...

&lt;!-- Script: This example underscores the importance of good graphs in science communication. A recent Nature article included a figure that was misinterpreted, leading to concerns about reinforcing racist beliefs. The chart aimed to show genetic diversity but ended up being misinterpreted as supporting genetic essentialism. This highlights the need for careful design and interpretation of scientific figures to ensure accurate and responsible communication of data. Good graphs should accurately represent data without misleading the audience, and researchers must consider the potential for misinterpretation. --&gt;

# Developing Resources

### Atlas with `ggplot2` in R

- A comprehensive guide for researchers to create effective visualizations using ggplot2.
- Includes examples of various types of plots and when to use them.
- Aims to standardize and improve the quality of visualizations in behavior genetics.
- Provides practical tips and best practices for creating clear and informative plots.

&lt;!-- Slide 5: Developing Resources - Atlas (1 minute) --&gt;
&lt;!-- Script: To support researchers in choosing the most appropriate visualization techniques, we are developing an atlas using `ggplot2` in R. This resource aims to guide researchers through the process of selecting and implementing visualizations that enhance the clarity and interpretability of their data. --&gt;

## Proposed R Package

Integration with `OpenMx`:
- Streamlines the creation of visualizations for structural equation modeling (SEM) and other complex analyses. (Probably attempting to generalize `DiagrammeR` to works beyond RAM models)
- Provides functions for creating path diagrams, correlation matrices, and other visualizations compatible with the data structures used in `OpenMx`.
- Aims to make advanced visualization tools more accessible to researchers in behavior genetics.

&lt;!-- Slide 6: Developing Resources - R Package (1 minute) --&gt;
&lt;!-- Script: In addition to the atlas, I am gauging interest in developing an R package that integrates with `OpenMx`. This package will streamline the creation of visualizations for complex genetic analyses, making it easier for researchers to present their findings clearly and effectively. --&gt;
